DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The symmetric cipher commands allow data to be encrypted or decrypted
       using various block and stream ciphers using keys based on passwords or
       explicitly provided. Base64 encoding or decoding can also be performed
       either by itself or in addition to the encryption or decryption.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --_cc_ii_pp_hh_ee_rr
           The cipher to use.

       --hheellpp
           Print out a usage message.

       --lliisstt
           List all supported ciphers.

       --cciipphheerrss
           Alias of -list to display all supported ciphers.

       --iinn _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           The input filename, standard input by default.

       --oouutt _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           The output filename, standard output by default.

       --ppaassss _a_r_g
           The password source. For more information about the format of _a_r_g
           see ooppeennssssll--ppaasssspphhrraassee--ooppttiioonnss(1).

       --ee  Encrypt the input data: this is the default.

       --dd  Decrypt the input data.

       --aa  Base64 process the data. This means that if encryption is taking
           place the data is base64 encoded after encryption. If decryption is
           set then the input data is base64 decoded before being decrypted.

       --bbaassee6644
           Same as --aa

       --AA  If the --aa option is set then base64 process the data on one line.

       --kk _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d
           The password to derive the key from. This is for compatibility with
           previous versions of OpenSSL. Superseded by the --ppaassss argument.

       --kkffiillee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           Read the password to derive the key from the first line of
           _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  This is for compatibility with previous versions of
           OpenSSL. Superseded by the --ppaassss argument.

       --mmdd _d_i_g_e_s_t
           Use the specified digest to create the key from the passphrase.
           The default algorithm is sha-256.

       --iitteerr _c_o_u_n_t
           Use a given number of iterations on the password in deriving the
           encryption key.  High values increase the time required to brute-
           force the resulting file.  This option enables the use of PBKDF2
           algorithm to derive the key.

       --ppbbkkddff22
           Use PBKDF2 algorithm with default iteration count unless otherwise
           specified.

       --nnoossaalltt
           Don't use a salt in the key derivation routines. This option SSHHOOUULLDD
           NNOOTT be used except for test purposes or compatibility with ancient
           versions of OpenSSL.

       --ssaalltt
           Use salt (randomly generated or provide with --SS option) when
           encrypting, this is the default.

       --SS _s_a_l_t
           The actual salt to use: this must be represented as a string of hex
           digits.  If this option is used while encrypting, the same exact
           value will be needed again during decryption.

       --KK _k_e_y
           The actual key to use: this must be represented as a string
           comprised only of hex digits. If only the key is specified, the IV
           must additionally specified using the --iivv option. When both a key
           and a password are specified, the key given with the --KK option will
           be used and the IV generated from the password will be taken. It
           does not make much sense to specify both key and password.

       --iivv _I_V
           The actual IV to use: this must be represented as a string
           comprised only of hex digits. When only the key is specified using
           the --KK option, the IV must explicitly be defined. When a password
           is being specified using one of the other options, the IV is
           generated from this password.

       --pp  Print out the key and IV used.

       --PP  Print out the key and IV used then immediately exit: don't do any
           encryption or decryption.

       --bbuuffssiizzee _n_u_m_b_e_r
           Set the buffer size for I/O.

       --nnooppaadd
           Disable standard block padding.

       --vv  Verbose print; display some statistics about I/O and buffer sizes.

       --ddeebbuugg
           Debug the BIOs used for I/O.

       --zz  Compress or decompress encrypted data using zlib after encryption
           or before decryption. This option exists only if OpenSSL was
           compiled with the zlib or zlib-dynamic option.

       --nnoonnee
           Use NULL cipher (no encryption or decryption of input).

       --rraanndd _f_i_l_e_s, --wwrriitteerraanndd _f_i_l_e
           See "Random State Options" in ooppeennssssll(1) for details.

       --pprroovviiddeerr _n_a_m_e
       --pprroovviiddeerr--ppaatthh _p_a_t_h
       --pprrooppqquueerryy _p_r_o_p_q
           See "Provider Options" in ooppeennssssll(1), pprroovviiddeerr(7), and pprrooppeerrttyy(7).

       --eennggiinnee _i_d
           See "Engine Options" in ooppeennssssll(1).  This option is deprecated.

NNOOTTEESS
       The program can be called either as "openssl _c_i_p_h_e_r_" or "openssl enc
       -_c_i_p_h_e_r_". The first form doesn't work with engine-provided ciphers,
       because this form is processed before the configuration file is read
       and any ENGINEs loaded.  Use the ooppeennssssll--lliisstt(1) command to get a list
       of supported ciphers.

       Engines which provide entirely new encryption algorithms (such as the
       ccgost engine which provides gost89 algorithm) should be configured in
       the configuration file. Engines specified on the command line using
       --eennggiinnee option can only be used for hardware-assisted implementations
       of ciphers which are supported by the OpenSSL core or another engine
       specified in the configuration file.

       When the enc command lists supported ciphers, ciphers provided by
       engines, specified in the configuration files are listed too.

       A password will be prompted for to derive the key and IV if necessary.

       The --ssaalltt option should AALLWWAAYYSS be used if the key is being derived from
       a password unless you want compatibility with previous versions of
       OpenSSL.

       Without the --ssaalltt option it is possible to perform efficient dictionary
       attacks on the password and to attack stream cipher encrypted data. The
       reason for this is that without the salt the same password always
       generates the same encryption key.

       When the salt is generated at random (that means when encrypting using
       a passphrase without explicit salt given using --SS option), the first
       bytes of the encrypted data are reserved to store the salt for later
       decrypting.

       Some of the ciphers do not have large keys and others have security
       implications if not used correctly. A beginner is advised to just use a
       strong block cipher, such as AES, in CBC mode.

       All the block ciphers normally use PKCS#5 padding, also known as
       standard block padding. This allows a rudimentary integrity or password
       check to be performed. However, since the chance of random data passing
       the test is better than 1 in 256 it isn't a very good test.

       If padding is disabled then the input data must be a multiple of the
       cipher block length.

       All RC2 ciphers have the same key and effective key length.

       Blowfish and RC5 algorithms use a 128 bit key.

SSUUPPPPOORRTTEEDD CCIIPPHHEERRSS
       Note that some of these ciphers can be disabled at compile time and
       some are available only if an appropriate engine is configured in the
       configuration file. The output when invoking this command with the
       --lliisstt option (that is "openssl enc -list") is a list of ciphers,
       supported by your version of OpenSSL, including ones provided by
       configured engines.

       This command does not support authenticated encryption modes like CCM
       and GCM, and will not support such modes in the future.  This is due to
       having to begin streaming output (e.g., to standard output when --oouutt is
       not used) before the authentication tag could be validated.  When this
       command is used in a pipeline, the receiving end will not be able to
       roll back upon authentication failure.  The AEAD modes currently in
       common use also suffer from catastrophic failure of confidentiality
       and/or integrity upon reuse of key/iv/nonce, and since ooppeennssssll eenncc
       places the entire burden of key/iv/nonce management upon the user, the
       risk of exposing AEAD modes is too great to allow.  These key/iv/nonce
       management issues also affect other modes currently exposed in this
       command, but the failure modes are less extreme in these cases, and the
       functionality cannot be removed with a stable release branch.  For bulk
       encryption of data, whether using authenticated encryption modes or
       other modes, ooppeennssssll--ccmmss(1) is recommended, as it provides a standard
       data format and performs the needed key/iv/nonce management.

       Encrypt a file using AES-128 using a prompted password and PBKDF2 key
       derivation:

        openssl enc -aes128 -pbkdf2 -in file.txt -out file.aes128

       Decrypt a file using a supplied password:

        openssl enc -aes128 -pbkdf2 -d -in file.aes128 -out file.txt \
           -pass pass:<password>

       Encrypt a file then base64 encode it (so it can be sent via mail for
       example) using AES-256 in CTR mode and PBKDF2 key derivation:

        openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pbkdf2 -a -in file.txt -out file.aes256

       Base64 decode a file then decrypt it using a password supplied in a
       file:

        openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pbkdf2 -d -a -in file.aes256 -out file.txt \
           -pass file:<passfile>

BBUUGGSS
       The --AA option when used with large files doesn't work properly.

       The ooppeennssssll eenncc command only supports a fixed number of algorithms with
       certain parameters. So if, for example, you want to use RC2 with a 76
       bit key or RC4 with an 84 bit key you can't use this program.

       The default digest was changed from MD5 to SHA256 in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

       The --lliisstt option was added in OpenSSL 1.1.1e.

       The --cciipphheerrss and --eennggiinnee options were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
