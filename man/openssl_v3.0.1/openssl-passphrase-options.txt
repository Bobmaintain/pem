       Several OpenSSL commands accept password arguments, typically using
       --ppaassssiinn and --ppaassssoouutt for input and output passwords respectively. These
       allow the password to be obtained from a variety of sources. Both of
       these options take a single argument whose format is described below.
       If no password argument is given and a password is required then the
       user is prompted to enter one: this will typically be read from the
       current terminal with echoing turned off.

       Note that character encoding may be relevant, please see

       Pass phrase arguments can be formatted as follows.

       ppaassss::_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d
           The actual password is _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d. Since the password is visible to
           utilities (like 'ps' under Unix) this form should only be used
           where security is not important.

       eennvv::_v_a_r
           Obtain the password from the environment variable _v_a_r. Since the
           environment of other processes is visible on certain platforms
           (e.g. ps under certain Unix OSes) this option should be used with
           caution.

       ffiillee::_p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e
           The first line of _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is the password. If the same _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e
           argument is supplied to --ppaassssiinn and --ppaassssoouutt arguments then the
           first line will be used for the input password and the next line
           for the output password. _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e need not refer to a regular file:
           it could for example refer to a device or named pipe.

       ffdd::_n_u_m_b_e_r
           Read the password from the file descriptor _n_u_m_b_e_r. This can be used
           to send the data via a pipe for example.

       ssttddiinn
           Read the password from standard input.
