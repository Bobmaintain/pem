NSEQ(1)                             OpenSSL                            NSEQ(1)



NNAAMMEE
       openssl-nseq, nseq - create or examine a Netscape certificate sequence

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       ooppeennssssll nnsseeqq [--hheellpp] [--iinn ffiilleennaammee] [--oouutt ffiilleennaammee] [--ttoosseeqq]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The nnsseeqq command takes a file containing a Netscape certificate
       sequence and prints out the certificates contained in it or takes a
       file of certificates and converts it into a Netscape certificate
       sequence.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --hheellpp
           Print out a usage message.

       --iinn ffiilleennaammee
           This specifies the input filename to read or standard input if this
           option is not specified.

       --oouutt ffiilleennaammee
           Specifies the output filename or standard output by default.

       --ttoosseeqq
           Normally a Netscape certificate sequence will be input and the
           output is the certificates contained in it. With the --ttoosseeqq option
           the situation is reversed: a Netscape certificate sequence is
           created from a file of certificates.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Output the certificates in a Netscape certificate sequence

        openssl nseq -in nseq.pem -out certs.pem

       Create a Netscape certificate sequence

        openssl nseq -in certs.pem -toseq -out nseq.pem

NNOOTTEESS
       The PPEEMM encoded form uses the same headers and footers as a
       certificate:

        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----

       A Netscape certificate sequence is a Netscape specific format that can
       be sent to browsers as an alternative to the standard PKCS#7 format
       when several certificates are sent to the browser: for example during
       certificate enrollment.  It is used by Netscape certificate server for
       example.

BBUUGGSS
       This program needs a few more options: like allowing DER or PEM input
       and output files and allowing multiple certificate files to be used.
