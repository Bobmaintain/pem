       This command generates _n_u_m random bytes using a cryptographically
       secure pseudo random number generator (CSPRNG).

       The random bytes are generated using the RRAANNDD__bbyytteess(3) function, which
       provides a security level of 256 bits, provided it managed to seed
       itself successfully from a trusted operating system entropy source.
       Otherwise, the command will fail with a nonzero error code.  For more
       details, see RRAANNDD__bbyytteess(3), RRAANNDD(7), and RRAANNDD__DDRRBBGG(7).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --hheellpp
           Print out a usage message.

       --oouutt ffiillee
           Write to _f_i_l_e instead of standard output.

       --rraanndd ffiillee......
           A file or files containing random data used to seed the random
           number generator.  Multiple files can be specified separated by an
           OS-dependent character.  The separator is ;; for MS-Windows, ,, for
           OpenVMS, and :: for all others.  Explicitly specifying a seed file
           is in general not necessary, see the "NOTES" section for more
           information.

       [--wwrriitteerraanndd ffiillee]
           Writes random data to the specified _f_i_l_e upon exit.  This can be
           used with a subsequent --rraanndd flag.

       --bbaassee6644
           Perform base64 encoding on the output.

       --hheexx
           Show the output as a hex string.

NNOOTTEESS
       Prior to OpenSSL 1.1.1, it was common for applications to store
       information about the state of the random-number generator in a file
       that was loaded at startup and rewritten upon exit. On modern operating
       systems, this is generally no longer necessary as OpenSSL will seed
       itself from a trusted entropy source provided by the operating system.
       The --rraanndd  and --wwrriitteerraanndd  flags are still supported for special
       platforms or circumstances that might require them.

       It is generally an error to use the same seed file more than once and
       every use of --rraanndd should be paired with --wwrriitteerraanndd.
