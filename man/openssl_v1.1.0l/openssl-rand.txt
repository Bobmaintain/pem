RAND(1)                             OpenSSL                            RAND(1)



NAME
       openssl-rand, rand - generate pseudo-random bytes

SYNOPSIS
       openssl rand [-help] [-out file] [-rand file(s)] [-base64] [-hex] num

DESCRIPTION
       The rand command outputs num pseudo-random bytes after seeding the
       random number generator once.  As in other openssl command line tools,
       PRNG seeding uses the file $HOME/.rnd or .rnd in addition to the files
       given in the -rand option.  A new $HOME/.rnd or .rnd file will be
       written back if enough seeding was obtained from these sources.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -out file
           Write to file instead of standard output.

       -rand file(s)
           Use specified file or files or EGD socket (see RAND_egd(3)) for
           seeding the random number generator.  Multiple files can be
           specified separated by an OS-dependent character.  The separator is
           ; for MS-Windows, , for OpenVMS, and : for all others.

       -base64
           Perform base64 encoding on the output.

       -hex
           Show the output as a hex string.
